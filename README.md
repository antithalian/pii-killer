# PII Killer for Reddit

Python application that connects to your Reddit account and have you review all (or some) of your comments. If you choose to delete a comment, it edits it to a random phrase, then proceeds to delete it. This, to my knowledge, prevents certain methods of recovering deleted comments from working. Worst case, it doesn't work, the Python interpreter does some extra work, and we all carry on like nothing happened!
